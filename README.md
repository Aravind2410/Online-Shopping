**Introduction**

The Online Shopping project is a simulated e-commerce system, providing users with a range of products to browse, add to their cart, and place orders. The project is written in C to keep it simple and portable across different platforms.

**Requirements**

To run the Online Shopping project, you need the following:
C Compiler: A C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any compatible compiler.
Terminal or Command Prompt: The project runs in a console-based environment, so any terminal or command prompt should suffice.

**Usage**

Upon running the application, users will be presented with a command prompt to log in or register if they are new users. Once logged in, they can navigate the product catalog, search for products, add items to their cart, and place orders.
The application will provide on-screen instructions and options to guide the user through the process.

**Contributing**

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you find any issues or want to enhance the system, please feel free to reach out us aravindramesh2410@gmail.com.
